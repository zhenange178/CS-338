        <h2>About</h2>
        This project is for blah blah blah. You can use it to do this or that, something about H&M I assume. Our members consist of this guy and that guy. We used something something to build the site. The database will be setup locally using something something. To setup, make sure you've downloaded this and that and enabled something else. See [link to github readme] for details on setup. Etc...

        <br/><h2>Initialization</h2>
        Product data is retrieved from H&M's website using an API, then stored locally. You can update this information whenever you like. Click below to view details and additional actions.
        <br/>
        <a href="data.php" class="button">View Data</a> (Click here to initialize the data, view saved data, or update existing data) <br/><br/>
        Once the data is fetched and saved, a database can be created with the following structure: "something something". Maybe a link here to create the database and tables. Maybe combine it with the link above. We can work on this.
